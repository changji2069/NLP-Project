believes the innovation is fully consistent with its third world debt strategy a reagan administration official said the official s comments also suggest that debtors pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms in addition he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a megabank where third world debt would be pooled and suggested the administration would support such a plan even though it was not formally proposing it at the same time however the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground the philippine proposal together with argentine suggestions that exit bonds be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan the official said in an interview with reuters all of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered said the official who asked not to be named in october washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund imf were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations in return america called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation free economic growth the multilaterals have been performing well the debtors have been performing well said the official but he admitted that the largest third world debtor brazil was clearly an exception the official who played a key role in developing the u s debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the third world debt crisis we called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively the official said among those ideas the official said were suggestions that commercial banks create a megabank which could swap third world debt paper for so called exit bonds for banks like regional american or european institutions such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled and has been suggested by argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of billion dlrs he emphasised that the megabank was not an administration plan but something some people have suggested other u s officials said japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume third world debt this plan actively under consideration would differ slightly from the one the official described but the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the united states if the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go fine i don t think they ever will he pointed out that banks would swap their third world loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution meanwhile the official praised the philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than pct above libor the philippine proposal is very interesting it s quite unique and i don t think it s something that should be categorically rejected out of hand the official said banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of philippine investment notes these tradeable dollar denominated notes would have a six year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity the country would guarantee a payment of point over libor until now bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low the talks now in their second week are aimed at stretching out repayments of billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on billion of already rescheduled debt the country which has enjoyed strong political support in washington since corazon aquino came to power early last year owes an overall billion dlrs of debt but the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation a development until now unacceptable to the banks it s no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over libor from what existed before the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek some people argue that cutting the spread is debt forgiveness what it really is is narrowing the spread on new money he added he said the u s debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the philippines reuter

5091,business,u s fed explores commodity basket index the complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices the newest member of the federal reserve board says commodity prices are already considered by the fed in the making of monetary policy but they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by governor robert heller who joined the board last august he conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed but argues that such an arrangement particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries could reduce the volatility of exchange rates moreover it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves slowing changes in inflation his idea which many conservative economists find appealing has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by president reagan it would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation key indicators such as unemployment and the rise or fall of the money supply changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly discussed on and off for a long time the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base what is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes says heller in the past this anchor was gold but the united states went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies a return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the soviet union and south africa the so called fixed rate system scuttled in the early s is still considered unworkable in the present world but the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely adding vast pressures to the monetary system is also being widely questioned some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also for one thing there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy moreover some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement the poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that not surprisingly helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems treasury secretary james baker the reagan administration s chief economic architect has preferred to use the so called group of five industrial countries or sometimes seven as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters he appears convinced that officials from west germany france britain japan italy and canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing the heller approach while extremely complex could have a profound impact on the system ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates as envisioned by heller a basket of say major commodities ranging from wheat to oil would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis in times of rising commodity prices monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices montary policy might be eased he says he notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis moreover most commodity prices are produced consumed and traded on a world wide basis so that an index has a relevance for the entire world he says in addition commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions he says however he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the s because of action by the opec cartel would have to be discounted in such a system he says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities reuter

5264,business,economic spotlight polish sanctions poland says u s sanctions have cost its economy billion dlrs and has made clear it wants washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses some of them are too sophisticated to convert into financial terms one banking source said but western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate they say it is blurred by the poor performance of poland s economy and dismiss the billion dlr figure as illusory sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under achieving they did have a bad effect yes but they only contributed to largely internal economic problems one said the u s imposed the measures and withdrew most favoured nation mfn trading status from poland in in retaliation for suppression of the solidarity free trade union under martial law the estimated cost to the polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the institute of national economy an offshoot of the central planning commission according to one western envoy an expert on polish economic affairs it extrapolated information on growth trends in trade with the united states as well as increases in credits from western commercial and government lenders but the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely he said dismissing the estimate as a theoretical projection based on a high point which has no real scientific evaluation a foreign trade ministry official said polish exports to the u s in the late s averaged around mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed imports have suffered slumping from around mln dlrs to mln as credits ran out poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the west last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted billion official figures show acknowledging that sanctions have lost poland important u s markets including agricultural equipment textiles chemicals and some foodstuffs western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons poland is accusing the west of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons said one expert it s an illusion based on a misunderstanding of western economy there s a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it another said adding that poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the s which were no longer today s reality describing the billion dlr assessment as nebulous one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new mfn status will have little impact on poland which has a hard currency debt of billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry mfn doesn t really mean anything only that poland will not be treated worse than other countries it will be difficult to regain access to the u s market because different forces are in play now said one western envoy he said polish products were not competitive and their quality was too low trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the u s japan and europe would also hamper poland s efforts to regain entry deputy foreign trade minister janusz kaczurba recognised this fact recently kaczurba told the official pap news agency recently making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult and in certain cases impossible in a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about mln dlrs while poland is unlikely to seek compensation it says it has a moral right to assistance from the u s which it says imposed the sanctions illegally but a western economist said the argument that u s sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the polish economy won t cut any ice the americans will just reply that the poles acted immorally in crushing solidarity nevertheless polish national bank head wladyslaw baka in talks in washington last week with the international monetary fund imf and world bank made it clear that poland was looking for a lead from the united states he was quoted by pap as saying that poland would meet its financial obligations to the united states but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners he stressed that the u s had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of poland s partners interested in the settlement of polish debt putting it more sharply one senior banking official blamed washington for obstructing talks with the world bank imf and paris club of western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role as a major superpower

at japan s expense said richard koss at general motors corp february s paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted nics to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies but this two pronged
